# configurator
my ubuntu bash script configurator for my developer needs

this script will install the following tools on your Ubuntu (might work with other debian distros)

+ Git
+ Java 8
+ Maven
+ Nodejs V6
+ Apache
+ Terminator
+ Idea Intellij \*
+ Google App Engine Java SDK \*
+ Google Chrome \*
+ Atom.io \*
+ Smartgit \*

the ones with the * the configurator tries to download the .deb files in case it doesnt find them on the ~/Programs folder so you can save time by download them before hand.

the configurator will also modify the file .bashrc to add the appengine sdk and global npm

this is a work in progress fell free to contribute. 

It was tested on Ubuntu 16.04
